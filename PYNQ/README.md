# File Description

* **weight_reorg_ap16_skin_v1.1.bin** – First training result on the **YOLOv2_tiny** skin disease dataset, using 1600 images, most of which are of the **nv** type. The performance was poor.
* **weight_reorg_ap16_skin_v1.2.bin** – Second training result on the **YOLOv2_tiny** skin disease dataset, with a more balanced distribution of disease categories. Due to some categories having fewer than 100 samples, the total number of images was only about 800. The performance was slightly better.
* **weight_reorg_ap16_yolov2.bin** – **YOLOv2** test weights.
* **weight_reorg_ap16.bin** – **YOLOv2** weights trained on the **COCO** dataset.
